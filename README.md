# Pointer_Merge_Sort

An implementation of the Merge Sort that is using pointers to sort integers. This implementation uses manual memory allocation and deallocation. This implementation is useful because Merge Sort is notorius for its large memory consumption and due to this fact, liked lists have to be used, which will hamper the performace dramatically.

# Implementation

Open the project settings and allow the use of unsafe code, in order for the C# application to be able to compile and run this application that is using pointers;
