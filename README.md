# üîÄ Pointer Merge Sort

An optimized Merge Sort implementation using pointers to sort integers. This approach utilizes manual memory allocation and deallocation, aiming to improve performance and reduce memory consumption compared to traditional array-based implementations. Pointer-based implementation strikes a balance between the speed of arrays and the memory efficiency of linked lists.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation
1) Enable Unsafe Code: Open project settings and enable unsafe code to allow pointer usage in C# or the option below in the **.csproj** configuration file:
```
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net5.0</TargetFramework>  <!-- Adjust based on your version -->
    <AllowUnsafeBlocks>true</AllowUnsafeBlocks>  <!-- Enable unsafe code -->
  </PropertyGroup>
```

2) After enabling unsafe code, compile and run the application with pointer-based Merge Sort for optimized memory usage.

3) Enjoy the performance boost with manual memory management while using Merge Sort to efficiently sort integers.
